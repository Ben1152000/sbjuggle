Welcome to the Home Page for the Santa Barbara Jugglers Association and for the Juggling Club at UCSB! We are open to everybody interested in juggling. Come out and learn to juggle, learn new tricks or pass clubs with the "experienced" jugglers. Other props too: diablo, unicycle, cigar boxes, hula hoops, poi balls, etc. Bring your toys!
