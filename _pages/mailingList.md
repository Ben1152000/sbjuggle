If you want to come out and juggle with us, it's a good idea to join the mailing list. Sometimes we juggle at different locations or times. Sometimes nobody will show up at all! If there is a change in the meeting time or location, then a message is sent out to the e-mail list. You can easily unsubscribe at any time, and your e-mail address won't be distributed to anyone else.

To join the list, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/SBJA/subscribe" target="_blank">click here</a> and enter your e-mail address.

To unsubscribe from the list, 
<script language=javascript> 
	<!-- 
		//anti-spam email script 
		var link = "click here" 
		var user = "SBJA+unsubscribe" 
		var domain = "googlegroups.com" 
		document.write("<A href="+"mail"+"to:"+user+"@"+domain+">"+link+"</A>") 
	//--> 
</script>
and send the e-mail that is created. (If a "click here" link is not displayed above, then unsubscribe by sending an e-mail to "SBJA+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com". More information on unsubscribing from the list is available <a href="https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46608" target="_blank">here</a>.)

You don't need to join the list to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/SBJA" target="_blank">read the current list of messages</a>.

The e-mail list is sponsored by Google. Feel free to <a href="http://groups.google.com/intl/en/googlegroups/about.html" target="_blank">check them out</a> to assure yourself that they are legitimate. You may especially be interested in their <a href="http://groups.google.com/intl/en/googlegroups/privacy.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.
