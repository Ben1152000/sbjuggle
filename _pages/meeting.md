### Weekend Meetings:

We usually meet every Saturday from 3:00pm - 6:00pm (or dark).

In these pandemic times we normally meet at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Oak+Park,+Santa+Barbara,+CA&sll=34.428436,-119.726455&sspn=0.051256,0.132093&g=Santa+Barbara,+CA&ie=UTF8&hq=Oak+Park&hnear=Oak+Park,+Santa+Barbara,+California&ll=34.430452,-119.727759&spn=0.025628,0.066047&z=15&iwloc=A" target="_blank">Oak Park</a>.

In the before (pandemic) times, during the UCSB school year, we would meet in <a HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=34+24+43.50+N,+119+51+22.48+W&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=50.02446,135.263672&ie=UTF8&ll=34.427018,-119.824276&spn=0.102656,0.32959&z=13" target="_blank">Anisq'oyo Park</a>, "downtown" Isla Vista. We'll likely return to Isla Vista when the students and grass return.

### Alternate Locations:

Sometimes, especially during the summer, we meet at alternate locations in order to partake in local happenings. Click <a href="/calendar">here</a> for the calendar.
