    Harriet Eckstein is interim director of the 
    <a href="http://www.sbrapecrisiscenter.org/" target="_parent">Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center</a>. 
    She has been a beginning juggler for 20 years.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></i><font face="Times New Roman">Twenty years ago, Isla Vista was my
    home. In many ways it is the same today as it was then except there was no
    cappuccino-to-go, Morninglory sold vinyl record and eight-track tapes, only one shop sold
    beer, and no one, except for Japanese exchange students, had heard of sushi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The war in Vietnam had ended, but the war on women
    continued. On November 20, 1976, Jacqueline Ann Rook, a 21-year-old resident advisor at
    Francisco Torres dorm, disappeared. Mary-Ann Sarris, a 19-year-old waitress who worked at
    two Goleta restaurants, was abducted two weeks later. There was a rape reported in an Isla
    Vista apartment and another in one of the dorms. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A young woman named Patty Laney, a 21-year-old UCSB
    student who volunteered at the I.V. Credit Union, the Food Co-op, and the fledging Isla
    Vista Medical Clinics, was one of the many Isla Vista residents who helped nail up posters
    to raise awareness about sexual assault. Along with
    the members of the I.V. Women&#146;s Center, the I.V. Community Council, Das Institut, and
    the relatively new rape Crisis Center, Patty and dozens of other residents mobilized to
    seek clues to the murders.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Warnings about hitchhiking were
    everywhere; women drivers were urged to &#147;pick up a sister,&#148; and the community
    picketed MTD offices to provide evening bus service between Isla Vista and Santa Barbara.
    There were rallies and consciousness-raising groups. Letters about sexual assault filled
    the editorial pages of the Santa Barbara <i>News-press, </i>the<i> Daily Nexus, </i>and
    the <i>Alternative. </i>Unlike Patty, many of us didn&#146;t hand out flyers, we
    didn&#146;t attend rallies, we weren&#146;t politicized. We were just scared.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Patty Laney was last seen at a bus stop at
    the corner of Hollister and Patterson on January 18, 1977. She had just finished
    rehearsing her juggling act with a friend for her first public show -- a benefit for a
    local nonprofit group -- and was on her way to her mime class. Her body was found in
    Refugio Canyon the following day.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;Sheriff's Department eventually
    arrested a 21-year-old Goleta man after he attempted to murder a young hitchhiker in
    Hollywood. He was a student at Santa Barbara City College, described by his live-in
    girlfriend as &#147;very, very nice,&#148; and had worked as a waiter in his father&#146;s
    Danish restaurant in Solvang. An Ellwood Beach neighbor described him as &#147;open and
    friendly.&#148; The former Santa Ynez. High School honor student pleaded guilty three and
    a half years after he raped and murdered Patty, Jackie, and Mary Ann.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">A few months after Patty died, some of her
    juggling friends were asked to give a benefit performance. Members of the I.V. Gorilla
    Theater helped them quickly pull together a routine and introduced the group with a
    pseudo-Italian accent as the Strombolis. The name stuck, the group continued to practice
    together, and in April of the same year, the Strombolis declared a festival in honor and
    memory of their friend and fellow juggler, Patty Laney.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now mountain bikes have replaced old Schwinn Varsities and
    buzz-cuts outnumber ponytails. The war on women continues, but the Strombolis, the Santa
    Barbara Rape Crisis Center, and others continue to work toward peace. As sparkling clubs
    and flaming torches and fluorescent balls fly through the air and unicyclists, magicians,
    and jugglers trade tricks, the 20<sup>th</sup> Annual Isla Vista April Fool&#146;s
    Jugglers&#146; Festival celebrates the life of Patty Laney. And, as has been the case for
    20 years, the public show on Saturday night is a benefit for the Rape Crisis Center. This
    year the show is particularly significant because the featured performer is a woman who
    was born only a year before Patty died -- 22-year-old Francoise Rochais is the
    International Juggling Association World Champion<i>.</i></font></font></td>
